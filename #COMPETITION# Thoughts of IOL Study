The IOL winter camp is over today. I have got a new understanding of linguistics in just four days of online training. Before studying linguistics, I thought that it as an unpredictable subject. However, after learning it, I discovered that it is actually closely related to our world. 

We learned basic knowledge, such as phonetics, phonology, language family, semantics, morphology, syntax and so on. We also learned how to solve problems. The problem-solving process is like doing fieldwork -- deciphering a new language.

I learned that languages are regular. I learned vowel, consonants and their different ways of pronunciation. I also studied the International Phonetic Alphabet, which is an outstanding contribution of linguists to the world. I learned about root affixes and the rules of word formation. At the same time, the teachers prepared many related questions for us. We analyzed the expression rules of these strange languages, and then infer the meaning of other compound words and sentences through the translations we already know.

In this study, I thought many new languages, which refreshed the world in my heart. I never expected that civilizations were so diverse. At the same time, in the summary of the language rules, I also found their unity. As a result, I can't help but admire the magic of the world. In addition, during the process of analyzing, I also exercised my thinking ability. I find that I am more organized and can think more logically.

I believe that this winter camp will have a profound impact on my future research. Thanks to my teachers and teammates!
